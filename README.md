# autonomous_car_simulation_ros
This project is motivated by the idea of learning the tools and the environment to simulate
autonomous vehicles.
The objectives that are covered in our project are :
  * To investigate the available methods to simulate autonomous vehicles
  * To build an environment (circuit track) in Gazebo
  * To find a car model to use in the environment (URDF File)
  * To launch the environment along with the car
  * To investigate image processing techniques for a lane follower in turtlebot3
  * To implement the working algorithm used on turtlebot3 in our car model
